# Magma Clothing eStore

This `project` is part of `MagmaLabs' Solidus Course` for training Ruby on Rails Developers.

## About Magma Clothing

`Magma Clothing Inc.` is a company that manufactures and provides uniforms for different schools in M√©xico. To provide better service they need an e-commerce solution so their clients can acquire their products online.

The new system must support the following requirements:

- Product's price depends on size and color of each product
- Price also depends if bought individually or as wholesale
- Some schools require name printed on the tshirts, offer the ability to add custom data(printed tag) to the cart for some products during checkout
- Uniforms are specific for each school, thus, customers could potentially filter by 'compatibility'.
- Products must match gender, for example, a woman's shirts can not be mixed with men's jeans.
- Additional methods of payment are Oxxo Pay and Mercado Pago
- Tax calculation must consider that on Mexican border zone a different tax rate applies (8%)
- Schools must be able to pre-define sets of packages for their students, so customers by using a `magic-click` can load it. For example a school may define a set of 3 blue shirts, 2 withe shirts and 5 skirts for womans.
